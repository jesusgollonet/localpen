# localpen
A script to start a local 'pen' (as in [http://codepen.io/](codepen))

The basic idea is a single command that gives you a sketching environment
with all elements ready to code. That means an editor, server, build tools,
livereload, etc.

### planned languages:

- html/css/js
- supercollider
- ...

### compatibility

My current local setup includes vim, tmux and iterm on osx, so I'll focus
on that first.

### status

This is readme-driven-development, which means nothing is done yet : )
