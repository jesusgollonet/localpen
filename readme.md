# localpen
A script to start a local 'pen' (as in [http://codepen.io/](codepen))

The basic idea is a single command that gives you a sketching environment
with all elements ready to code. That means an editor, server, build tools,
livereload, etc.

### general usage (for html)

- $ htmlpen
- temp folder is created for the project (make this optional. either --here or in a central throaway folder)
- editor opens with everything ready
- the browser opens too
- tmux launches a session with all servers and watchers

### planned languages:

- html/css/js
- supercollider
- ...

### compatibility

My current local setup includes vim, tmux and iterm on osx, so I'll focus
on that first.

### status

This is readme-driven-development, which means nothing is done yet : )
